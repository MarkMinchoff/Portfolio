# Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!

 You may have found me here through [my website](https://www.markminchoff.com/) or just stumbled upon it by accident. My name is Mark Minchoff and through various online tools I am learning how to code. I will be uploading projects (mostly those written in Python) to this repository. If you have any question about me or what I'm doing please feel free to ask.
